# Oreon Watchdog
Oreon Watchdog is a basic HTML-served website for listing CVEs for Linux and other related components via an RSS feed by cvefeed.

It is very basic. It is written in Go and uses a styled HTML webpage

## Running Locally
To run it locally, make sure you have `golang` installed on your system. On Oreon Lime (R2) or later, you can run `sudo dnf install golang`.

Once you've done that, you can run the program using `go run main.go` and then the content will show up on localhost:8080.
